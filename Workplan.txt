3.1, The temperature of a given day: Yichen Liu
-make histogram
-return staDev
-return mean

3.2, The temperature for every day of the year: Martin Waites
-run previous for all days,
-plot

Our result, The temperature for every day of the year Latitude comparison: Martin Waites
- we intend on comparing the 3.2 results from different places dependant on latitude.
